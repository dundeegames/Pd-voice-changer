#X text 55 10 Execution order • Much of the time \, the actual execution
order of pd audio rate objects need not concern us. • It is important
to remember that audio processing is done in blocks: these are audio
vectors (buffers): the default block size is 64 samples. Ordinarily
\, objects do not process audio on a sample by sample basis. pd ensures
that the order of execution is such \, that an audio rate objects’s
output block is not calculated \, until all the inputs for the same
block have been computed first. • However \, when working with delays
\, order does become important \, as we are relying on the past values
of samples. • It is important to write to the delay line before it
is read. • If the delay line is read before it is written to \, the
minimum delay it is possible to have is one audio block (e.g. 64 samples
or ca. 1.45 msecs at 44.1kHz sampling rate). This is \, of course \,
not a problem for long delays \, but for designing patches that use
shorter delays \, such as flangers and comb filters \, this becomes
a problematic limit. • One useful method of ensuring the correct
execution order is to put delay writers and delay readers in separate
subpatches. The order in which subpatches are connected \, guarantees
their order of execution. As long as the output of the delay line writer
is attached to the input of the delay line reader \, then the delay
line will always be written to before it is read.;
